# Today's Star Trek

This project was created in collaboration with [karolyhars](https://github.com/karoly-hars). The content is generated via **GPT-2 natural language generation model** trained on real Star Trek episode summaries collected from Wikipedia and IMDb. Check out his [repo](https://github.com/karoly-hars/gpt2_episode_summary_generator) for more info.

The webpage is created with **React** and it uses **Firebase** for storing the episodes' data.

The design was inspired by the famous Star Trek LCARS [control panel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCARS). :movie_camera:
